usage: example_app <command> [<args>]

The most commonly used example_app commands are:
   php        Example of a php handler located at routes/php.php
   bash       Example of a bash handler located at routes/bash.sh
   help       Example of a theme element

Calling 'example_app' without a command is equivalent to 'example_app help'.
This can be configured using the variable $lobster_default_route.
