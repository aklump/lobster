Copy the folder called example_app as titanium somewhere on your computer and start building your app.  That is the only folder you need from this repository to bundle with your app. Rename titanium\/gitignore to titanium\/.gitignore. Rename example_app.sh as  titanium.sh; this will be the controller for the app. Copy dist\/.lobsterconfig to titanium\/.lobsterconfig and modify the necessary items. Copy dist\/.example_appconfig to titanium\/.titaniumconfig and use this file for any configuration used by your app. Sample routes have been provided in example_app\/routes.

If a route cannot be found, then a tpl will be sought. Core routes can be overridden, e.g. 'init'   Theme tpls   You may have more than one theme, but not more than one active theme. Configure the types and order of files via $lobster_tpl_extensions. Place tpl files in \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl   The Route\/Theme Cascade  Given that a user types:  $ my_app.sh do re mi   Then the first existing file from in the following list will be used:  \/routes\/do.re.mi.sh \/routes\/do.re.mi.php \/routes\/do.re.sh \/routes\/do.re.php \/routes\/do.sh \/routes\/do.php \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.re.mi.twig \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.re.mi.txt \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.re.twig \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.re.txt \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.twig \/themes\/{lobster_theme}\/tpl\/do.txt   Route options  You can pass options to routes in two ways: flags and parameters.  Here is an example of a route with a parameter+value:  app op --color=red   .. It is not necessary for a param to have a value:  app op --debug   Here are examples with two flags, with identical effect:  app op -v -d app op -vd   Route flags   A flag is an argument that begins with a single -, e.g. -v. A flag cannot have a value (see parameter) Flags must be single characters. Flags may be grouped like this -asdf, which signifies four flags.   Route parameters   A parameter is an argument that begins with a double hyphen, e.g., '--verbose' It may have a value assigned, e.g., --file=my_file.txt   Option order is irrelevent  Lobster doesn't care the order of the args, flag or params.  All of the following have the same effect:  app arg1 -abcd --param=value arg2 arg3 app -abcd --param=value arg1 arg2 arg3 app --param=value arg1 -abcd  arg2 arg3 ...

To disable this feature you need to add the following line to your app controller file just before calling the bootstrap:  lobster_core_verbose=0 source \"$LOBSTER_APP_ROOT\/lib\/lobster\/dist\/bootstrap.sh\"   Setting this variable in a config file is too late as the boostrapping process uses verbosity before loading all config files.
