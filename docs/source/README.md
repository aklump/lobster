# Lobster Shell
A BASH framework by In the Loft Studios.

## Getting started
If you are making an app called "Titanium"...

1. Copy the folder called `example_app` as `titanium` somewhere on your computer and start building your app.  That is the only folder you need from this repository to bundle with your app.
1. Rename `titanium/gitignore` to `titanium/.gitignore`.
1. Rename `example_app.sh` as  `titanium.sh`; this will be the controller for the app.
1. Copy `dist/.lobsterconfig` to `titanium/.lobsterconfig` and modify as needed.
1. Sample routes have been proved in `example_app/routes`.

## Lobster Documentation
1. HTML documentation is found at `/docs/public_html`.
